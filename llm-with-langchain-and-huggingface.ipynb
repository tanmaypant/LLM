This allows quantum computers to perform many calculations at once, potentially solving complex problems much faster than classical computers.\n\nAnother key feature of quantum computing is entanglement, a phenomenon where the state of one qubit is directly related to the state of another, regardless of the distance between them. This allows for faster and more efficient communication between qubits, enabling quantum computers to perform complex calculations more quickly.\n\nQuantum computing has the potential to revolutionize various fields, including cryptography, drug discovery, optimization problems, and artificial intelligence.

It'ieves in developing algorithms which can improve their performance at a specific task over time with more experience or exposure, without being explicitly programmed for each new situation they encounter. This process mimics human intelligence by allowing machines to 'learn', adapt, and evolve through patterns recognition within vast amounts of information. \n\nHow does ML differ from traditional programming methods used before its advent? Traditional computer programs are written using explicit instructions provided by humans who define every possible scenario an application might face during execution - this approach doesn’t scale well when dealing with complex tasks involving large datasets because it requires extensive manual coding effort. On contrary, Machine Learning automates much part if these processes making them scalable across various applications like image classification, speech recognition etc., wherein instead of hardcoding rules into software systems; we train models offline against historical examples then deploy those trained model online so as not needing any further updates until there exist significant changes/new trends emerging out-of-the blue!\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":23},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Other open source model","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# model_id = \"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\"\n# quantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(\n#     load_in_4bit=True,\n#     bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,\n#     bnb_4bit_quant_type=\"nf4\",\n#     bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16\n# )\n\n# model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, quantization_config=quantization_config)\n# tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\n# pipe = pipeline(\n#     model=model,\n#     tokenizer=tokenizer,\n#     task=\"text-generation\",\n#     temperature=0.1,\n#     max_new_tokens=500,\n#     do_sample=True,\n#     repetition_penalty=1.1,\n#     return_full_text=False,\n# )\n# llm = HuggingFacePipeline(pipeline=pipe)\n# input = \"What is the first programming language?\"\n\n# output = llm.invoke(input)\n\n# print(output)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-10T17:56:52.761358Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-10T17:56:52.761666Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-10T17:56:52.765739Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-10T17:56:52.761645Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-10T17:56:52.764658Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":24},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Adapting the prompt","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"template=\"\"\"\n<|begin_of_text|>\n<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n{system_prompt}\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n{user_prompt}\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\"\"\"","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-10T18:19:05.797065Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-10T18:19:05.797367Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-10T18:19:05.801237Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-10T18:19:05.797346Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-10T18:19:05.800228Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":35},{"cell_type":"code","source":"input","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-10T18:19:07.445766Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-10T18:19:07.446099Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-10T18:19:07.451342Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-10T18:19:07.446070Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-10T18:19:07.450425Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":36,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'what is machine learning?'"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":36},{"cell_type":"code","source":"system_prompt= \"You are a good one!\"\nuser_prompt= input","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-10T18:19:08.839440Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-10T18:19:08.839754Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-10T18:19:08.843389Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-10T18:19:08.839727Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-10T18:19:08.842621Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":37},{"cell_type":"code","source":"prompt_template= template.format(system_prompt=system_prompt, user_prompt=user_prompt)\nprompt_template","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-10T18:19:09.362713Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-10T18:19:09.363044Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-10T18:19:09.367888Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-10T18:19:09.363017Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-10T18:19:09.367261Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":38,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'\\n<|begin_of_text|>\\n<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\\nYou are a good one!\\n<|eot_id|>\\n<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\nwhat is machine learning?\\n<|eot_id|>\\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n'"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":38},{"cell_type":"code","source":"output= llm.invoke(prompt_template)\noutput","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-10T18:19:40.082231Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-10T18:19:40.082518Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-10T18:20:06.888621Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-10T18:19:40.082497Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-10T18:20:06.887866Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":39,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'Machine Learning (ML) refers to the field of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems capable of improving their performance through experience. Unlike traditional programming, where explicit instructions define every step for problem-solving tasks, ML algorithms learn patterns and make decisions from data inputs without being explicitly programmed with rules or logic.

Imagine if our friend John Doe were discussing real-world scenarios showcasing this marvel. He might say something along the lines of, “Consider the world of finance first,” he would begin. Here, financial institutions employ what resembles culinary intuition developed over years – similar to master chefs who know precisely how long each ingredient must simmer before serving up perfection. These organizations harness vast amounts of transactional records, customer behaviors, market trends, all seasoned together until predictions regarding stock movements become increasingly accurate. With each new batch of transactions added to the mix, the system fine-tunes its forecasts, enhancing precision bit by bit - mirroring a chef adjusting flavors based upon feedback received during taste tests.\\n'"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":39},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
